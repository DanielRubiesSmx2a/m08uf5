			<h1>Space Exploration</h1>

				<p>

					<b>Space exploration</b> is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the </br>exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is </br>conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, <small>like its classical </br>form astronomy</small>, is one of the main sources for space science.

					</br>While the observation of objects in space, <mark>known as astronomy</mark>, predates reliable recorded history, it was the </br>development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical </br>space exploration to become a reality. The world's first large-scale experimental rocket program was <del>Opel- </br>RAK</del> under the leadership of <sub>Fritz von Opel</sub> and Max Valier during the late 1920s leading to the first manned

					rocket cars and rocket planes, which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities </br>from 1950 onwards. The Opel-RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air </br>vehicles drew large crowds, as well as caused global public excitement as so-called "<i>Rocket Rumble</i>" and had

					a <u>large long-lasting impact</u> on later spaceflight pioneers like <sup>e.g Wernher von Braun</sup>. Common rationales for </br>exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring </br>the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.
